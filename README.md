# Odin Recipes

This is the first project of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">The Odin Project</a> course that covers the basics of HTML and CSS, like anchors, images, font style, etc.

The project's theme is a list of recipes that redirects you to a page with all the ingredients and steps to make them.
